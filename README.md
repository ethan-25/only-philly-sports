**A clean, easy way to get scores and times from today's Philadelphia sports games.**

Being an avid Philadelphia sports fan myself, I check the scores and times for upcoming games each and every day. I want to be able to save time and not have to constantly open a new tab and google "sixers" or "eagles" just to remind myself that a game is scheduled today. Luckily, I made an MS Edge add-on just for this! 

***

## Features

* Scheduled game times for the Sixers, Phillies, and Flyers (Eagles scores are a work in progress)
* Live scores are updated after a refresh
* Final scores posted at the end of each game

## Notes

* Phillies double-headers will not display correctly. It will only get info for the second game
* Games lasting over midnight will not display correctly. Instead, it will show the upcoming game
* Times are only in 24-hour format in EST
* Scores reset at midnight
* If no games are found for a team, the score card will not appear

## To Do

* Eagles scores
* Settings Page
* Team Standings Page
* Better code
