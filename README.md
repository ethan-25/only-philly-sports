**A clean, easy way to get scores and times from today's Philadelphia sports games.**

Being an avid Philadelphia sports fan myself, I check the scores and times for upcoming games each and every day. I want to be able to save time and not have to constantly open a new tab and google "sixers" or "eagles" just to remind myself that a game is scheduled today. Only Philly Sports does just that.

## Features

* Scheduled game times for the Sixers, Phillies, and Flyers
